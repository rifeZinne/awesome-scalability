In this article, we will show you how to use IAR EWARM 6.5 for ARM development. We will cover the following topics:
 
- How to install and configure IAR EWARM 6.5
- How to create and build a simple project
- How to debug and test your code
- How to store a const variable in a certain address

## How to Install and Configure IAR EWARM 6.5
 
To install IAR EWARM 6.5, you need to download the installer from the official website[^3^]. You can choose either the full edition or the evaluation edition. The full edition requires a license key, while the evaluation edition has a 14-day time limitation with no state limit.
 
After downloading the installer, run it and follow the instructions on the screen. You can choose the default settings or customize them according to your preferences. The installation process may take some time depending on your system configuration.
 
Once the installation is complete, you can launch IAR EWARM 6.5 from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut. You will see the main window of the IDE, which consists of several panes and toolbars. You can adjust the layout and appearance of the IDE by using the View menu or dragging and dropping the panes.
  
## How to Create and Build a Simple Project
 
To create a new project in IAR EWARM 6.5, you need to select File > New > Workspace from the menu bar. A workspace is a container for one or more projects that share common settings and resources. You can name your workspace and choose a location to save it.
 
Next, you need to add a new project to your workspace by selecting Project > Create New Project from the menu bar. A project is a collection of source files, header files, libraries, and other files that are compiled and linked together to produce an executable file.
 
You can choose from various project templates based on your target device and application type. For example, you can choose an empty project, a blinky project, or a C/C++ project. You can also import an existing project from another IDE or toolchain.
 
After choosing a project template, you need to specify the name and location of your project. You also need to select your target device from a list of supported devices[^1^]. You can use the search feature by clicking Ctrl + F to find your device quickly.
 
Once you have created your project, you can add source files, header files, libraries, and other files to it by using the Project menu or the Project Explorer pane. You can also edit your code using the built-in editor, which provides features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, code folding, and error checking.
 
To build your project, you need to select Project > Make from the menu bar or press F7. This will invoke the compiler and linker to generate an executable file for your target device. You can view the build output in the Build Messages pane.
  
## How to Debug and Test Your Code
 
To debug and test your code in IAR EWARM 6.5, you need to select Project > Download and Debug from the menu bar or press Ctrl + D. This will download your executable file to your target device and launch the debugger.
 
The debugger allows you to control the execution of your code on your target device. You can use features such as breakpoints, watch variables, memory view, register view, call stack, disassembly view, and trace view to inspect and modify your code behavior.
 
You can also use the simulator to debug and test your code without connecting a physical device. The simulator emulates the behavior of your target device based
