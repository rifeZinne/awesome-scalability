In this article, we will show you how to use IRender nXt 5 for SketchUp to create stunning architectural renderings in a few simple steps.
  
## Step 1: Install IRender nXt 5 for SketchUp
  
The first step is to install IRender nXt 5 for SketchUp on your computer. You can download a free 30-day trial from the Render Plus Software website[^4^] or purchase a license for $499 USD[^5^]. The installation process is straightforward and you can follow the instructions on the screen. Once installed, you will see a new toolbar in SketchUp with the IRender nXt icon.
  
## Step 2: Prepare Your SketchUp Model
  
The next step is to prepare your SketchUp model for rendering. You can use any SketchUp model that you have created or imported from other sources. You can also use the built-in components and materials in SketchUp or download more from the 3D Warehouse. IRender nXt 5 will automatically recognize the materials and textures applied to your model and render them accordingly. However, you can also customize them using the IRender nXt Material Editor, which allows you to adjust the reflection, transparency, bump, glow, and other properties of each material.
  
You can also add lighting to your model using the IRender nXt Lighting Editor, which lets you place different types of lights such as spotlights, point lights, area lights, sun and sky, and HDRi skies. You can control the intensity, color, direction, and shadow of each light source. You can also use the IRender nXt Light Balancer to fine-tune the overall brightness and contrast of your scene.
  
## Step 3: Render Your SketchUp Model
  
The final step is to render your SketchUp model using IRender nXt 5. You can access the rendering settings from the IRender nXt toolbar or menu. You can choose from several presets such as interior, exterior, daytime, or night-time scenes or create your own custom settings. You can also adjust the resolution, quality, anti-aliasing, depth of field, and other parameters of your rendering.
  
Once you are ready, you can click on the Render button and wait for IRender nXt 5 to generate your rendering. Depending on the complexity of your model and the quality of your settings, this may take from a few seconds to several minutes. You can monitor the progress of your rendering on the IRender nXt Rendering Window, which also allows you to pause, resume, or cancel your rendering at any time.
  
When your rendering is done, you can save it as an image file in various formats such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, or BMP. You can also use the IRender nXt Image Editor to crop, rotate, resize, or enhance your rendering with filters and effects. You can also create 360 degree panoramas or animations from your renderings using the IRender nXt Panorama Wizard or Animation Wizard.
